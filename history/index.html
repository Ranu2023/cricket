			<h2> ONE DAY CRICKET WORLD CUP </h2>
			<h3>Before the first Cricket World Cup</h3>

			<p>The first international cricket match was played between Canada and the
				United States, on 24 and 25 September 1844. However, the first credited
				Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England, and the two
				teams competed regularly for The Ashes in subsequent years.
				South Africa was admitted to Test status in 1889.
				<br /> Representative cricket teams were selected to tour each other,
				resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic
				sport at the 1900 Paris Games,where Great Britain defeated France to win the
				gold medal. This was the only appearance of cricket at the Summer Olympics.</p>

			<p>The first multilateral competition at international level was the 1912
				Triangular Tournament, a Test cricket tournament played in England between
				all three Test-playing nations at the time: England, Australia and South
				Africa.
				The event was not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play
				difficult
				on damp uncovered pitches, and attendances were poor, attributed to a
				"surfeit of cricket".
				<br>Since then,international Test cricket has generally been organised as
				bilateral series:
				a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular
				Asian Test Championship in 1999.</p>

			<p>The number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time,
				with the addition of West Indies in 1928, New Zealand in 1930, India in
				1932, and Pakistan in 1952. However, international cricket continued to
				be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days.</p>

			<p>In the early 1960s, English county cricket teams began playing a shortened
				version of cricket which only lasted for one day. Starting in 1962 with a
				four-team knockout competition known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup,and
				continuing with the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963, one-day cricket grew in
				popularity in England.
				<br>A national Sunday League was formed in 1969. The first One-Day
				International
				match was played on the fifth day of a rain-aborted Test match between
				England and Australia at
				Melbourne in 1971, to fill the time available and as compensation for the
				frustrated crowd.
				It was a forty over game with eight balls per over.</p>

			<p>In the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket
				(WSC) competition. It introduced many of the now commonplace features of One
				Day International cricket, including coloured uniforms, matches played at
				night under
				floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television
				broadcasts, multiple camera angles,effects microphones to capture sounds
				from the
				players on the pitch,and on-screen graphics.
				<br>The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians
				in wattle gold versus
				WSC West Indians in coral pink,played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January
				1979.
				<br>The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in
				England and other parts of the world,
				as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider
				organising a Cricket World Cup.</p>

			<h3>Prudential World Cups (1975 to 1983)</h3>

			<p>The inaugural Cricket World Cup was hosted in 1975 by England, the only
				nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude
				at the time. The 1975 tournament started on 7 June.
				<br>The first three events were held in England and officially known as the
				Prudential Cup after
				the sponsors Prudential plc. The matches consisted of 60 six-ball overs per
				team, played during the daytime in traditional
				form, with the players wearing cricket whites and using red cricket balls.</p>

			<p>Eight teams participated in the first tournament: Australia, England,
				India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the West Indies (the six Test nations at
				the time), together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa.
				<br>One notable omission was South Africa, who were banned from
				international cricket due to apartheid.
				The tournament was won by the West Indies, who defeated Australia by 17 runs
				in the final at Lord's.</p>

			<p>The 1979 World Cup saw the introduction of the ICC Trophy competition to
				select non-Test playing teams for the World Cup, with Sri Lanka and Canada
				qualifying. The West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament,
				defeating the hosts
				England by 92 runs in the final.
				<br> At a meeting which followed the World Cup,the International Cricket
				Conference agreed to make the competition a quadrennial
				event.</p>

			<p>The 1983 event was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this
				stage, Sri Lanka had become a Test-playing nation, and Zimbabwe qualified
				through the ICC Trophy.
				<br>A fielding circle was introduced, 30 yards (27 m) away from the stumps.
				Four
				fieldsmen needed to be inside it at all times. The teams faced each other
				twice, before moving into the knock-outs. India, an outsider, quoted at 66–1
				to win by bookmakers
				before the competition began, were crowned champions after upsetting the
				West Indies by 43 runs in the final.</p>

			<h3>Different champions (1987 to 1996)</h3>

			<p>India and Pakistan jointly hosted the 1987 tournament, the first time that
				the competition was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to
				50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight
				hours in the Indian
				subcontinent compared with England's summer.
				<br>Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in
				the final, the closest margin in World Cup final history.</p>

			<p>The 1992 World Cup, held in Australia and New Zealand, introduced many
				changes to the game, such as coloured clothing, white balls, day/night
				matches, and a change to the fielding restriction rules. The South African
				cricket team
				participated in the event for the first time, following the fall of the
				apartheid regime and the end of the international sports boycott.
				<br>Pakistan overcame a dismal start in the tournament to eventually defeat
				England by 22 runs in the final and emerge
				as winners.</p>

			<p>The 1996 championship was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second
				time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for some of its group stage
				matches. In the semi-final, Sri Lanka, heading towards a crushing victory
				over India at Eden Gardens
				after the hosts lost eight wickets while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 252,
				were awarded victory by default after crowd unrest broke out in protest
				against the Indian
				performance.
				<br>Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden championship by defeating
				Australia by seven wickets in the final at Lahore.</p>

			<h3>Australian treble (1999 to 2007)</h3>

			<p>In 1999 the event was hosted by England, with some matches also being held
				in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Netherlands. Twelve teams contested the
				World Cup. Australia qualified for the semi-finals after reaching their
				target
				in their Super 6 match against South Africa off the final over of the match.
				<br>They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi-final
				also against South Africa where a mix-up between South African batsmen Lance
				Klusener and Allan Donald saw Donald drop his bat and stranded mid-pitch to
				be run out. In the final, Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then
				reached the
				target in less than 20 overs and with eight wickets in hand</p>

			<p>South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the 2003 World Cup. The number of
				teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen. Kenya's
				victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others – and a forfeit by the
				New Zealand
				team, which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns – enabled
				Kenya to reach the semi-finals, the best result by an associate.
				<br>In the final,Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets, the
				largest ever total
				in a final, defeating India by 125 runs.</p>

			<p>In 2007 the tournament was hosted by the West Indies and expanded to
				sixteen teams. Following Pakistan's upset loss to World Cup debutants
				Ireland in the group stage,Pakistani coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his
				hotel room.
				<br>Jamaican police had initially launched a murder investigation into
				Woolmer's death
				but later confirmed that he died of heart failure.
				<br> Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the final by 53 runs (D/L) in farcical
				light conditions,
				and extended their undefeated run in the World Cup to 29
				matches and winning three straight championships.</p>

			<h3>Hosts triumph (2011 to 2019)</h3>

			<p>India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh together hosted the 2011 Cricket World
				Cup. Pakistan were stripped of their hosting rights following the terrorist
				attack on the Sri Lankan cricket
				team, with the games originally scheduled for Pakistan redistributed to the
				other host countries.<br /> The number of teams participating in the World
				Cup
				dropped down to fourteen.<br />
				Australia lost their final group stage match against Pakistan on 19 March
				2011, ending an unbeaten streak of 35 World Cup matches, which had begun on
				23 May 1999.<br /> India won
				their second World Cup title by beating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final
				in Mumbai, and became the first country to win the final on home soil.</p>

			<p>Australia and New Zealand jointly hosted the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The
				number of participants remained at fourteen. Ireland was the most successful
				Associate nation with
				a total of three wins in the tournament. New Zealand beat South Africa in a
				thrilling first semi-final to qualify for their maiden World Cup final.
				<br>Australia defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the final at
				Melbourne to
				lift the World Cup for the fifth time.</p>
			<p> The 2019 World Cup was hosted by England and Wales. The number of
				participants was reduced to 10. <br>New Zealand defeated India in the first
				semi-final, which was pushed over to the reserve day due to rain.
				England defeated the defending champions, Australia, in the second
				semi-final.<br> Neither finalist had previously won the World Cup.<br> In
				the
				final,
				the scores were tied at 241 after 50 overs and the match went to a super
				over, after which the scores were again tied at 15. <br>The World Cup was
				won by
				England, whose boundary count was greater than New Zealand's.</p>

			<h2> T20 CRICKET WORLD CUP </h2>
			<h3>BACKGROUND OF first T20 Cricket World Cup</h3>

			<p>Background
				When the Benson & Hedges Cup ended in 2002, the ECB needed[citation needed]
				another one-day competition to fill with the younger generation in response
				to dwindling crowds and reduced sponsorship.<br> The Board wanted to deliver
				fast-paced, exciting cricket accessible to thousands[quantify] of fans who
				were put off by the longer versions of the game.<br> Stuart Robertson, the
				marketing manager of the ECB, proposed a 20-over per innings game to county
				chairmen in 2001, and they voted 11–7 in favour of adopting the new format
			</p>

			<h4 style="color: rgb(226, 43, 168);">Inaugural tournaments(2007 T20 World
				Cup)</h4>

			<p>The 2007 ICC World Twenty20 was the inaugural Twenty20 International
				cricket world championship, contested in South Africa from 11 to 24
				September 2007. Twelve teams took part in the thirteen-day tournament—the
				ten Test-playing nations and the finalists of the 2007 WCL Division One
				tournament: Kenya and Scotland. India won the tournament, beating Pakistan
				in the final.
				<br></p>
			<h5>2009 T20 World Cup</h5>
			<p>The 2009 ICC World Twenty20 was an international Twenty20 cricket
				tournament organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) that took
				place in England in June 2009. It was the second ICC World Twenty20
				tournament, following the inaugural event in South Africa in September 2007.
				<br> As before, the tournament featured 12 male teams – nine of the ten
				Test-playing nations and three associate nations, which earned their places
				through a qualification tournament. Matches were played at three English
				grounds – Lord's and The Oval in London, and Trent Bridge in Nottingham. <br>The
				tournament was organised in parallel with the women's tournament, with the
				men's semi-finals and final being preceded by the semi-finals and final from
				the women's event.
				<br>The final took place at Lord's on Sunday 21 June with Pakistan beating
				Sri Lanka by eight wickets and England beating New Zealand by six wickets in
				the women's final.</p>
			<h5>2010 T20 World Cup </h5>
			<p>The 2010 ICC World Twenty20 was the third Men's T20 World Cup competition,
				an international Twenty20 cricket tournament that was held in the West
				Indies between 30 April and 16 May 2010. It was won by England, who defeated
				Australia in the final. Kevin Pietersen was named as player of the
				tournament.<br>

				Although the tournament was held every two years beginning in 2007, the
				scheduled ICC Champions Trophy, One Day International tournament to be held
				in the West Indies in 2010 was revised to a Twenty20 format because the 2008
				Champions Trophy tournament in Pakistan was postponed due to security
				concerns and there was a need to correct the international cricketing
				tournament calendar.<br>

				This ICC World Twenty20 took place only 10 months after the last one. As
				before, the tournament featured 12 teams – the Test-playing nations and two
				qualifiers. Matches were played at three grounds – Kensington Oval in
				Bridgetown, Barbados; Providence Stadium in Providence, Guyana; and
				Beausejour Stadium in Gros Islet, Saint Lucia. The tournament was organised
				in parallel with the women's tournament, with the men's semi-finals and
				final each being preceded by the semi-finals and final from the women's
				event.<br>

				This competition also saw Afghanistan make their first ever appearance in a
				major ICC international cricket tournament, and was made even more
				remarkable as at the time they only held Affiliate Membership and
				subsequently became the only Affiliate member ever to compete in a major ICC
				international cricket tournament.</p>

			<h5>2012 T20 World Cup</h5>

			<p>The 2012 ICC World Twenty20 was the fourth ICC World Twenty20 competition,
				an international Twenty20 cricket tournament that took place in Sri Lanka
				from 18 September to 7 October 2012 which was won by the West Indies.
				<br>This was the first World Twenty20 tournament held in an Asian country,
				the last three having been held in South Africa, England and the West
				Indies. Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga had been chosen as the event
				ambassador of the tournament by ICC. The format had four groups of three

				an international Twenty20 cricket tournament, that took place in Bangladesh
				from 16 March to 6 April 2014. It was played in three cities — Dhaka,
				Chittagong and Sylhet.
				<br>The International Cricket Council announced Bangladesh as host in
				2010.[6] It was the second consecutive time that an Asian country hosted the
				event, with Sri Lanka hosting the previous tournament in 2012. <br>Sri Lanka
				won the 2014 tournament, beating India by 6 wickets in the final at Mirpur.</p>

			<h5>2016 T20 World Cup</h5>

			<p>The 2016 ICC World Twenty20 was the sixth edition of the ICC World
				Twenty20, the world championship of Twenty20 International cricket. It was
				held in India from 8 March to 3 April 2016, and was the first edition to be

				Seven cities hosted matches in the tournament – Bangalore, Dharamshala,
				Kolkata, Mohali, Mumbai, Nagpur, and New Delhi. For the second time, there
				were 16 participating teams, 10 of which qualified automatically due to
				their status as full members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and
				another six qualifying through the 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier.<br> The
				tournament was divided into three stages. In the first stage, the eight
				lowest-ranked teams played off, with the top two joining the eight
				highest-ranked teams in the Super 10 stage. Finally, the top four teams
				overall contested the knockout stage. <br>In the final, played at Eden
				Gardens, Kolkata, the West Indies defeated England by four wickets. <br><i>Indian

				tournament, with the matches played in the United Arab Emirates and Oman
				from 17 October to 14 November 2021. The West Indies were the
				defending champions, but were eventually eliminated in the Super 12 stage.</p>

			<p>Originally, the event was scheduled to be held in Australia from 18
				October to 15 November 2020, but in July 2020, the International Cricket
				Council (ICC) confirmed that this tournament had been postponed, due to the
				COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, the ICC confirmed that India would host
				the 2021 tournament as planned, with Australia being named as the host for
				the succeeding 2022 tournament. However, in June 2021, the ICC announced
				that the tournament had been moved to the United Arab Emirates due to
				growing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic situation in India, and a
				possible third wave of the pandemic in the country due to the fears of Delta
				variant. The tournament began on 17 October 2021, with the tournament's
				final taking place on 14 November 2021. The preliminary rounds of the
				tournament were played in the UAE and Oman.</p>

			<p>New Zealand became the first team to reach the final, after they beat
				England by five wickets in the semi-finals. It was the first time that New
				Zealand had qualified for a T20 World Cup final. They were joined in the
				final by Australia, who beat Pakistan by five wickets in the second
				semi-final.<br> It was the second time that Australia had qualified for the

			<h2> WORLD TEST CHAMPIONSHIP </h2>
			<h3>BACKGROUND OF first WORLD TEST CHAMPIONSHIP</h3>

			<p>The ICC World Test Championship, also referred to as the Test World Cup,
				is a league competition for Test cricket run by the International Cricket
				Council (ICC), which started on 1st August 2019.
				<br>It is the premier championship for Test cricket. It is in line with the
				ICC's goal of having one pinnacle tournament for each of the three formats
				of international cricket.</p>

			<p>The original plans to hold the competition in 2009, replacing the 2013 ICC
				Champions Trophy, were abandoned. It was rescheduled for June 2017, with a
				second Test championship to take place in India in Feb-March 2021.
				<br> The top four ranked teams on 31 December 2016 – the cut-off date set by
				the ICC – would play the three-match Test championship. There would have
				been two semi-finals and the winners play the final. However, in January
				2014 the ICC World Test Championship was cancelled and the 2017 ICC
				Champions Trophy was reinstated.</p>

			<p><br>In October 2017, the ICC announced that a Test league had been agreed
				upon by its members, which would involve the top nine teams playing series
				over two years with the top two teams qualifying for a World Test League
				Championship Final, which will be considered as an ICC event.<br> The league
				games of WTC were not considered as an ICC event and the broadcasting rights
				were with the host nation's cricketing board itself and not with ICC. But
				unlike the league stage matches, the WTC finals were considered to be an ICC
				event.
				<br><br><br> The first ICC World Test Championship started with the 2019
				Ashes
				series and finished with New Zealand lifting the trophy after defeating
				India in the final in June 2021.
				<br><br>The second ICC World Test Championship
				started on 4 August 2021 with the Pataudi Trophy series and finished with
				Australia lifting the trophy after defeating India in the final in June
				2023.</p>

			<h4 style="color: rgb(226, 43, 168);">2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship</h4>
			<p>
				The first tournament began with the 2019 Ashes series. In March 2020,
				matches were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, not resuming before
				July 2020, with several rounds of matches being postponed or ultimately
				cancelled. <br>New Zealand became the first team to qualify for the final,
				when it was confirmed that the series between South Africa and Australia
				would not proceed, followed by India.
				<br><br>The inaugural World Test Championship Final was played between India
				and New Zealand from 18 to 23 June 2021 at Rose Bowl, Southampton, England.
				Despite the opening and fourth day of the final being washed out by rain,
				New Zealand managed to win in the final session of the reserve day and
				lifted the first World Test Championship trophy.</p><br>

			<h4 style="color: rgb(226, 43, 168);">2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship</h4>
			<p>
				The WTC 2021–23 cycle began in August 2021 with Pataudi Trophy (5 matches
				series between India and England). The International Cricket Council
				officially announced the full programme with a new points system.
				<br><br> Australia qualified for the final by winning the 3rd Test Match of
				the 2022–23 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. India qualified after Sri Lanka failed
				to win the first match of their series in New Zealand.
				<br>The final was played from 7 June to 11 June 2023 at The Oval, London,
				England, with Australia emerging as champions after defeating India by 209
				runs.</p>

			<h4 style="color: rgb(226, 43, 168);">2023–2025 ICC World Test Championship</h4>
			<p>
				The WTC 2023–25 cycle began with the 1st Ashes Test on 16 June 2023. The
