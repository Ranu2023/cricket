						<h2>ABOUT WORLD CUP</h2></p><section>
						<p>The ICC Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day
							International (ODI) cricket. The event is organised by
							<br />the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council
							(ICC),
							every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a
							<br />finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed
							sporting events and is considered the "flagship event of the
							<br />international cricket calendar" by the ICC.</p>

						<p>The first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the
							first ODI cricket match having been played only four years
							<br />earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been
							held
							two years before the first men's tournament, and a
							<br /> tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as
							early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was
							<br /> played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first
							three
							World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament
							<br /> onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an
							unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted
							<br /> at least one match in the tournament.</p>
						<p>
							The finals of the World Cup are contested by the ten full members of the
							ICC (all of which are Test-playing teams) and a number of
							<br />teams made up from associate and affiliate members of the ICC,
							selected via the World Cricket League and a later qualifying
							<br />tournament. A total of twenty teams have competed in the eleven
							editions of the tournament, with fourteen competing in the 2015
							<br /> tournament. The 2019 Cricket World Cup, hosted by England and
							Wales, was won by England. <br><i>Australia has won the tournament five
								times,
								with
								the
								West Indies, India (twice each), Pakistan and Sri Lanka and England
								(once
								each) also having won the tournament.</i> The best performance by a
							non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003
							tournament.

									<h2>ABOUT World Test Championship </h2></p><section>
									<p>The ICC World Test Championship, also referred to as the Test World
										Cup, is a league competition for Test cricket run by the International
										Cricket Council (ICC), which started on 1 August 2019. It is the
										premier championship for Test cricket. It is in line with the ICC's
										goal of having one pinnacle tournament for each of the three formats
										of international cricket.</p>
									<p>In October 2017, the ICC announced that a Test league had been
										agreed upon by its members, which would involve the top nine teams
										playing series over two years with the top two teams qualifying for a
										World Test League Championship Final, which will be considered as an
										ICC event.</p>
									<p><br>The league games of WTC were not considered as an ICC event and
										the broadcasting rights were with the host nation's cricketing board
										itself and not with ICC. But unlike the league stage matches, the WTC
										finals were considered to be an ICC event.<br>
										<br>The first ICC World Test Championship started with the 2019 Ashes
										series and finished with New Zealand lifting the trophy after
										defeating India in the final in June 2021.
										<br> The second ICC World Test Championship started on 4 August 2021
										with the Pataudi Trophy series and finished with Australia lifting
										the trophy after defeating India in the final in June 2023.</p>
