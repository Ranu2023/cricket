                <p> 4 August 2021 - 11 june 2023</p>
                <p>The 2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship was the second
                    edition of the ICC World Test Championship of Test cricket.
                    It started on 4 August 2021 and finished with the Final on
                    7–11 June 2023 at The Oval, London, played between Australia
                    and India.</p>
                <p>
                    It featured nine of the twelve Test playing nations, each of
                    whom was scheduled to play a Test series against six of the
                    other eight teams. Each series consisted of between two and
                    five matches, so although all teams were to play six series
                    (three at home and three away), they were not scheduled to
                    play the same number of Tests.<br> Each team were able to
                    score a maximum of 120 points from each series and the two
                    teams with the most points at the end of the league stage
                    would contest the final.<br> In the case of a draw or a tie
                    in the final, the two teams playing the final would be
                    declared joint champions.The ICC
                    announced that the finalists would be decided by percentage
                    of points earned.

            <p>The final of the 2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship, a Test
                cricket match, was played from 7 to 11 June 2023 at The Oval,
                London, between Australia and India.[1] Australia won the match
                by 209 runs to win the second edition of the ICC World Test

                US$800,000.The victory in the final established Australia as the
                first team to have won all ICC tournaments across three cricket
                formats.<br>
                The five-match Pataudi Trophy between England and India, started

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                <h5>Day 1</h5>
                Australian opener David Warner made a steady start for his team,
                while his partner Usman Khawaja fell for a duck to Mohammad
                Siraj's delivery. By the lunch break, Australia had reached a
                score of 73/2. Shortly after lunch, Marnus Labuschagne was
                dismissed by Mohammed Shami. Travis Head, batting at number
                five, adopted an aggressive approach and scored runs quickly,
                surpassing the fifty-run mark before tea.<br> At that stage,
                Australia's total stood at 170/3. Following tea, Head and Steve
                Smith formed a valuable partnership, reaching the milestone of a
                hundred runs together. Smith also completed his fifty during the
                course of their partnership. In the 66th over, Head achieved the
                significant feat of scoring a century, marking his first century
                outside of Australia.<br> By the end of the day's play, the
                partnership between Smith and Head had reached 251 runs, with
                Australia finishing strongly at 327/3. Head's individual score
                stood at 146, while Smith remained unbeaten on 95

                <h5>Day 2</h5>
                On the second day of the match, Smith also reached the milestone
                of scoring a century for the thirty-first time in Test cricket.
                However, the Indian pacers soon started taking wickets. Travis
                Head was dismissed by Siraj, followed by a quick succession of
                wickets with Cameron Green and Smith both falling, the latter
                being bowled by Shardul Thakur. By lunchtime, Australia's score
                stood at 422/7.<br> After the break, the wickets continued to
                tumble at one end while Alex Carey showed resilience with a
                knock of 48 before being adjudged lbw to Ravindra Jadeja. At a
                total of 469, the last tailender and captain Pat Cummins
                departed after being caught by Ajinkya Rahane at the covers.<br>
                It was then time for the Indian openers, Shubman Gill and
                captain Rohit Sharma, to take the field. However, Sharma was
                dismissed by opposition skipper Cummins, and shortly after, Gill
                made a judgment error and was bowled.<br> As tea approached,
                India found themselves at 30/2, with Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar
                Pujara at the crease. In the last session of the day, India
                continued to lose wickets, with Kohli and Pujara being dismissed
                by Mitchell Starc and Cameron Green, respectively.<br> Jadeja
                increased the scoring rate for the team before being caught by
                Smith off the bowling of Nathan Lyon. As the day concluded,
                India were on 151/5, with Rahane on 29, accompanied by
                wicketkeeper-batsman K. S. Bharat.

                <h5> Day 3</h5>
                At the beginning of the third day, Bharat fell swiftly to Scott
                Boland's bowling, while Thakur survived a dropped catch in the
                slips. Rahane eventually reached the fifty with a six, albeit
                being given another lifeline when Warner dropped him.<br>
                Cummins appeared to have Thakur dismissed lbw, but the decision
                was overturned due to a no-ball, similar to what happened with
                Rahane the previous day.<br> Approaching the lunch break, India's
                score reached 260/6. Shortly after lunch, Rahane's innings came
                to an end as he was caught by Green while on 89. Thakur managed
                to complete his fifty, but his dismissal triggered a collapse in
                India's score, concluding at 296 and trailing by 173 runs. <br>

                Australia's second innings commenced with an early setback, as
                Warner was caught behind off Siraj's bowling. By tea, Australia
                had reached 23/1. However, in the post-tea session, Khawaja also
                fell victim to a catch behind off Umesh Yadav's delivery.<br>
                Labuschagne and Smith then formed a fifty partnership, but their
                progress was halted when Smith's aggressive shot was caught off
                Jadeja's bowling.<br> Head, who had displayed exceptional form
                in the previous innings, entered the crease but soon fell prey
                to a caught and bowled off Jadeja's delivery, two balls after
                Yadav's fumble resulted in an unintended six. Australia
                concluded the day at 123/4, holding a lead of 296 runs.<br>

                <h5> Day 4 </h5>
                On the fourth day's commencement, Labuschagne was caught in the
                slip cordon by Pujara. Green and Carey displayed determined
                batting, forging a partnership that approached the fifty-run
                mark until Green's dismissal, wherein the ball dislodged the
                bails in an unconventional manner. By lunchtime, Australia's
                score stood at 201/6.<br> As play resumed, Carey reached his
                half-century after previously missing out, while Starc exhibited
                quick scoring at the other end. By the 79th over, Australia's
                lead exceeded 400 runs. Following Starc's departure on 41,
                Cummins was soon caught, prompting the declaration of the
                innings.<br>

                With a target of 444 runs, India faced the task of chasing down
                what would have been a record-breaking chase in Test cricket.
                The openers adopted an aggressive approach, scoring at a
                run-a-ball rate, until a contentious slip catch was claimed by
                Green off the bat of Gill. Before tea, India had reached 41/1 in
                7 overs of their innings. <br> Upon resumption, Pujara and
                Sharma constructed a fifty-run partnership, but Sharma fell
                victim to an lbw decision while attempting a lap-sweep off Lyon's
                bowling. Soon after, Pujara also departed.<br> However, Kohli
                and Rahane formed a seventy-run partnership, with Kohli on 44*
                and Rahane on 20*. As on the final day, India had to chase down
                a target of 280 runs.<br>

                <h5>Day 5 </h5>
                <p>On the final day of the game, the momentum shifted in favour
                    of Australia as Kohli, batting at 49, edged a delivery that
                    was caught by Smith, diving to his right to collect it
                    two-handed. Two balls later, Jadeja fell victim to Boland's
                    delivery, departing the field without adding any runs to the
                    scoreboard. <br>For India, the wickets continued to tumble,
                    and they were eventually bowled out for a total of 234 runs.
                    With this result, Australia emerged victorious in the
                    2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship, securing a 209-run
                    win.<br>Travis Head, who made significant contributions,
                    received player of the match award. This achievement
                    established Australia as the first and, thus far, the only
                    team to have won all ICC tournaments.</p>

                <h3>format</h3>
                <p>
                    The tournament was played over two years. Each team were
                    scheduled to play six other opponents, three at home and
                    three away. Each series consisted of between two and
                    five Test matches. <br>Therefore, all participants did
                    not play the same number of Tests, but played the same
                    number of series. At the end of the league stage the top
                    two teams played in the final. Each match is scheduled
                    for a duration of five days.
                </p>
                <h3>Point scoring</h3>
                <p>The ICC decided that the same number of points would be
                    available from each series, regardless of series length,
                    so that countries that played fewer Tests were not
                    disadvantaged. It also decided that points would not be
                    awarded for series results, but for match results only.
                    <br>These would be split equally between all the matches
                    in the series, regardless of whether or not a match was
                    a dead rubber, so that every match counted. In a
                    five-match series, therefore, 20% of the points would be
                    available each match, while in a two-match series, 50%
                    of the points would be available each match.<br><br><br><br>
                    Therefore, depending on whether the series is 2, 3, 4 or
                    5 matches long, the number of points awarded for a
                    single match win would be a half, a third, a quarter, or
                    a fifth of the maximum possible from the series. <br>The
                    ICC also decided that a tie should be worth half of a
                    win and that a draw should be worth a third of a win.
                    <br>This all meant that after each match, a side could
                    be awarded a half, a third, a quarter, a fifth, a sixth,
                    an eighth, a ninth, a tenth, a twelfth or a fifteenth of
                    the total points available from the series, depending on
                    the result and how many matches the series happened to
                    consist of. Ultimately, this meant a figure for the
                    total points available from the series needs to be
                    picked very carefully, as not many numbers give all
                    integers when split into all these different fractions
                    (360 does). <br>Being a highly composite number, when
                    120 was split into all these fractions, an integer was
                    obtained in all cases except one – the points awarded
                    for a draw in a 3-match series should be 131⁄3 (a third
                    of a third of 120), but the 1⁄3 had been dropped.</p>
                <p>
                    Each series would therefore carry a maximum of 120
                    points
                    <img src="../../images/wtct.jpg" alt><br>
                    A team that was behind the required over rate at the end of
                    a
                    match would have two competition points deducted for each
                    over
                    it was behind.<br>

                    >> Since each team played only six of the eight possible
                    opponents, the ICC announced that India and Pakistan would
                    not
                    play against each other in the first and second editions of
                    the
                    tournament.<br>
                    The schedule for the World Test Championship was announced
                    by
                    the ICC on 20 June 2018, as part of the 2018–2023 Future
                    Tours
                    Programme.

                    Rather than being a full round-robin tournament in which
                    everyone played everyone else equally, each team played only
                    six
                    of the other eight.</p>
