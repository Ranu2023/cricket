                <p> 14 November 2021</p>
                <p>The 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was the seventh ICC Men's
                    T20 World Cup tournament, with the matches played in the
                    United Arab Emirates and Oman from 17 October to 14 November
                    2021. The West Indies were the defending champions, but were
                    eventually eliminated in the Super 12 stage.</p>
                <p>Originally, the event was scheduled to be held in Australia
                    from 18 October to 15 November 2020, but in July 2020, the
                    International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that this
                    tournament had been postponed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
                    In August 2020, the ICC confirmed that India would host the
                    2021 tournament as planned, with Australia being named as
                    the host for the succeeding 2022 tournament. However, in
                    June 2021, the ICC announced that the tournament had been
                    moved to the United Arab Emirates due to growing concerns
                    over the COVID-19 pandemic situation in India, and a
                    possible third wave of the pandemic in the country due to
                    the fears of Delta variant.<br> The tournament began on 17
                    October 2021,[4] with the tournament's final taking place on
                    14 November 2021. The preliminary rounds of the tournament
                    were played in the UAE and Oman.</p>
                <p>
                    New Zealand became the first team to reach the final, after
                    they beat England by five wickets in the semi-finals. It was
                    the first time that New Zealand had qualified for a T20
                    World Cup final.<br> They were joined in the final by
                    Australia, who beat Pakistan by five wickets in the second
                    semi-final. It was the second time that Australia had
                    qualified for the final of the T20 World Cup, after reaching
                    the final of the 2010 tournament. <br> In the final,
                    Australia beat New Zealand by eight wickets to win their
                    first T20 World Cup. Mitchell Marsh was named the Player of
                    the Match, with David Warner being named the Player of the
                    Tournament.
                </p>In April 2020, the ICC confirmed that despite the COVID-19
                pandemic, the tournament was still planned to go ahead as
                scheduled. However, the following month a senior ICC official
                said that it would be "too big a risk" to host the tournament in
                2020,The ICC also stated that reports of postponing the
                tournament were inaccurate, with multiple contingency plans
                being looked at.<br> A decision on the tournament was originally
                deferred until the ICC's meeting on 10 June 2020,with a further
                announcement scheduled to be made in July 2020. In June 2020,
                Earl Eddings, the chairman of Cricket Australia, said that it
                was "unlikely" and "unrealistic" that the tournament would take
                place in Australia as scheduled. <br>Eddings also suggested that
                Australia could host the event in October 2021, and India stage
                the tournament a year later in 2022. The ICC also considered
                moving the tournament to be played around the next Women's ODI
                World Cup, which was originally scheduled to take place in New
                Zealand for February 2021.
                <p>
                    <p>
                        A month before the official postponement, Australian
                        federal tourism minister Simon Birmingham announced that
                        the Australian government expected that the country's
                        borders would be closed to international travel until
                        2021. The ICC also confirmed that either Australia or
                        India, the hosts for the tournaments originally
                        scheduled to take place in 2020 and 2021 respectively,
                        would host this tournament. <br>In August 2020, the ICC
                        confirmed that India are expected to host the 2021
                        tournament, with Australia expected to the 2022
                        tournament. In the same month, the ICC confirmed that
                        Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates were being
                        considered as back-up venues for the tournament. In
                        April 2021, the ICC's CEO Geoff Allardice confirmed that
                        back-up plans were still in place if India were unable
                        to host the tournament due to the pandemic. <br>Later
                        the same month, Dhiraj Malhotra of the Board of Control
                        for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed that the UAE would
                        be used as a contingency,if the pandemic in India
                        continued to get worse. The BCCI were also in talks with
                        Oman as a potential co-host of the tournament. On 1 June
                        2021, the ICC gave the BCCI the deadline of 28 June 2021
                        to make its decision on where the tournament would be
                        played.<br> Regardless of the actual location of the
                        tournament, the ICC also confirmed that the BCCI would
                        remain as the hosts of the competition. Later, the ICC
                        confirmed that the tournament had been moved to the UAE
                        and Oman. It was the first time for both the UAE and
                        Oman to be hosting a global ICC event, and also the
                        first occasion that a cricket World Cup was being held
                        entirely outside of the Test-playing nations.

                    <p>
                        Less than two weeks before the start of the tournament,
                        Oman was impacted by Cyclone Shaheen which passed only a
                        few miles north of the tournament venue in Al-Amerat.
                        Pankaj Khimji, chairman of Oman Cricket, stated that
                        "we were so close to being virtually wiped out had this had happened over here in this area, I'd have said goodbye to the World Cup".
                    </p>
                    <h4>qualification</h4>
                    <p>As of 31 December 2018, the top nine ranked ICC Full
                        Members, alongside hosts India, qualified directly for
                        the 2021 tournament. Of those ten teams, the top eight
                        ranked sides qualified for the Super 12s stage of the
                        tournament. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh did not qualify for
                        the Super 12s, instead being placed in the group stage
                        of the competition.They were joined by the six teams who
                        had qualified for the tournament via the 2019 ICC T20
                        World Cup Qualifier. Of the teams in the ICC Men's T20I
                        Team Rankings, the United Arab Emirates and Nepal could
                        only qualify through regional competitions. The top four
                        teams from the group stage advanced to the Super 12s.</p>
                    <p>Papua New Guinea were the first team to secure their
                        position via the Qualifier, after they won Group A of
                        the tournament, finishing above the Netherlands on net
                        run rate. It was the first time that Papua New Guinea
                        had qualified for a World Cup in any format. Ireland
                        became the second team to qualify via this route after
                        they won Group B, also on net run rate

                    </p>
                    <p>In the first match in the playoffs, the Netherlands
                        qualified for the T20 World Cup when they beat the
                        United Arab Emirates by eight wickets, after the UAE
                        only scored 80 runs in their innings. The second
                        qualifier match saw Namibia advance to their first T20
                        World Cup after beating Oman by 54 runs. Scotland beat
                        tournament hosts the United Arab Emirates in the third
                        qualifier by 90 runs to secure their place in the T20
                        World Cup. Oman became the final team to qualify for the
                        T20 World Cup, when they beat Hong Kong by 12 runs in
                        the last playoff match.

                    </p>
                    August 2021, concerns and doubts were raised over the
                    participation of Afghanistan cricket team in the tournament
                    ever since Afghanistan was brought under the control of the
                    Taliban. Afghanistan's team media manager Hikmat Hassan
                    confirmed that Afghanistan would play in the T20 World Cup,
                    despite the political turmoil in the country. On 6 October
                    2021, the Afghanistan team left Kabul, travelling to Doha,
                    Qatar, for a training camp before the start of the
                    tournament.
