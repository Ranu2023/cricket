                <p> 1 August 2019 - 23 june 2021</p>
                <p>The 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship was the inaugural
                    edition of the ICC World Test Championship of Test cricket.
                    It started on 1 August 2019 with the first Test of the 2019
                    Ashes series, and finished with the Final at the Rose Bowl,
                    Southampton in June 2021.</p>
                <p>It came nearly a decade after the International Cricket
                    Council (ICC) first approved the idea for a World Test
                    Championship in 2010, and following two cancelled attempts
                    to hold the inaugural competition in 2013 and 2017.</p>
                <p>
                    It featured nine of the twelve Test playing nations, each of
                    whom was scheduled to play a Test series against six of the
                    other eight teams. Each series consisted of between two and
                    five matches, so although all teams were to play six series
                    (three at home and three away), they were not scheduled to
                    play the same number of Tests.<br> Each team were able to
                    score a maximum of 120 points from each series and the two
                    teams with the most points at the end of the league stage
                    would contest the final.<br> In the case of a draw or a tie
                    in the final, the two teams playing the final would be
                    declared joint champions. However, the COVID-19 pandemic
                    impacted on the Championship, with several rounds of matches
                    being postponed or cancelled. In November 2020, the ICC
                    announced that the finalists would be decided by percentage
                    of points earned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the Test series in this Championship were part of a
                    longer ongoing series, such as the 2019 Ashes series. Also,
                    some of these nine teams would play additional Test matches
                    during this period which were not part of this Championship,
                    as part of the ICC Future Tours Programme for 2018–23,
                    mainly to give games to the three Test playing sides not
                    taking part in this competition. On 29 July 2019, the ICC
                    officially launched the World Test Championship.
                </p>
                <p>On 2 February 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia
                    postponed their away series against South Africa, resulting
                    in a guaranteed berth in the final for New Zealand. On 6
                    March 2021, India also confirmed their berth for the final,
                    after beating England by 3–1 in a home Test series. The
                    final saw New Zealand win by eight wickets, securing their
                    second global cricket title after their 2000 ICC KnockOut
                    Trophy win.

            <h3> venues </h3>
            <p>On 18-23 june 2021, the ICC confirmed the venues
                Panorama of the Rose Bowl, Southampton, the venue for the final
                match.</p>

            <h3>Final</h3>
            <p>The final of the 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship, the
                inaugural ICC World Test Championship, was played from 18 to 23
                June 2021 at the Rose Bowl, Southampton, England, between India
                and New Zealand.<br> It was initially scheduled for five days,
                but time lost during the game to rain interruptions meant that
                the planned reserve day was used.[1] New Zealand won the match
                by eight wickets to be crowned as the winners of the inaugural
                ICC World Test Championship.<br> New Zealand won the ICC Test
                Championship mace for the first time, and were also awarded the
                cash prize of US$1.6 million, while India won US$800,000.<br>

                It was New Zealand's second major ICC trophy win after emerging
                victorious at the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy, and Kane Williamson
                became the second New Zealand captain after Stephen Fleming to
                win an ICC event. <br>On winning the final, Williamson said it
                was a "very special occasion and a fantastic feeling". India's
                captain, Virat Kohli, acknowledged that New Zealand were the
                better team, but also called for a best-of-three series to
                decide future World Test Championships.<br> New Zealand's Kyle
                Jamieson was named as the man of the match, after taking seven
                wickets, including a five-wicket haul in the first innings <br>
                Kyle Jamieson 5/31 (22 overs)<br>
                Devon Conway 54 (153) <br>Tim Southee 4/48 (19 overs)<br>
                Kane Williamson 52* (89)</p>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                <h5>Day 1</h5>
                The first day of play was scheduled to take place on Friday 18
                June 2021. As had been forecast, there was heavy rain throughout
                the day which prevented any play from taking place. The rain
                stopped in the afternoon, but it had caused the outfield to
                become waterlogged and the umpires decided to cancel the day's
                play at 3pm BST. The loss of six hours ensured that the game
                would continue to the sixth and reserve day on Wednesday 23
                June.

                <h5>Day 2</h5>

                Players and match officials gathering in the field ahead of the
                start of Day 2 of the inaugural WTC Final
                The weather was dry at the start of the second day, and with no
                rain forecast, play began on time at 10:30am. New Zealand won
                the toss and elected to field first, putting India in to bat.
                Captain Kane Williamson said that his decision was due to the
                cool weather, although he said that he expected a consistent
                wicket throughout the game.India's opening batsmen, Rohit Sharma
                and Shubman Gill, began the match strongly by recording an
                opening partnership of 62 runs. Despite favourable conditions
                New Zealand's fast bowlers Tim Southee and Trent Boult were
                unable to bowl consistently.<br> Kyle Jamieson started bowling
                before lunch and took the first wicket of the match, Rohit
                Sharma edging a ball to third slip where it was caught by
                Southee. Gill then fell too, caught off the bowling of Neil
                Wagner, to leave India at 69 for two at lunch, with Cheteshwar
                Pujara and Indian captain Virat Kohli the two batsmen.<br>

                Pujara and Kohli batted cautiously early in their partnership,
                both before and after lunch, with Pujara taking 50 minutes and
                35 balls to score his first run. He then scored successive fours
                but was dismissed after 16 more runless balls, leg before wicket
                (lbw) to Boult.<br> The score at that point was 88 for three,
                with Ajinkya Rahane joining Kohli at the crease. There were
                several interruptions for bad light during the afternoon
                session, first forcing an early tea, and then eventually ending
                the day's play after only 64.4 overs with India on 146.[45][44]
                Kohli and Rahane remained as the not out batsmen overnight, on
                44 and 29 runs respectively.<br>

                The third day was another day of rain showers, and play was
                delayed slightly, beginning at 11am. Kohli fell in the third
                over of the day, lbw to Jamieson without adding to his overnight
                score of 44.<br> Rishabh Pant was dismissed a few overs later,
                caught by Tom Latham at slip off Jamieson's bowling on only 4
                runs. Rahane and new batsman Ravindra Jadeja withstood the New
                Zealand bowling for a while after this, with Rahane advancing
                his score to 49. He was then dismissed by Wagner, playing a hook
                shot which was caught at mid wicket.<br> Former Indian player V.
                V. S. Laxman attributed the wicket to Williamson's captaincy,
                noting that the captain had set the field differently in
                successive balls and given Wagner advice regarding Rahane's
                reputation for being a
                "compulsive pull shot or hook shot player".<br> Ravichandran
                Ashwin came to the crease and scored quickly, recording 22 runs
                from 27 balls and taking India past 200. He lost his wicket
                shortly afterwards, edging a catch to slip off the bowling of
                Southee. India were 211 for seven at lunch.<br>

                In the third over after lunch, Jamieson took two wickets in two
                balls, dismissing Ishant Sharma with a ball which was caught at
                slip, followed by an inswinger which dismissed Jasprit Bumrah
                for a duck. This gave Jamieson the opportunity to take a
                hat-trick, but he was unsuccessful as the next ball was hit by
                Mohammed Shami for four.<br> Nonetheless, Jamieson finished with
                bowling figures of 5 for 31 from 22 overs, with 12 maiden overs,
                a performance described by The Guardian's Tanya Aldred as
                "astonishing". Boult dismissed Jadeja for 15 in the first ball
                of the next over, leaving India all out for 217, a score which
                Aldred considered "slightly short of par".<br>

                Devon Conway and Tom Latham opened the batting for New Zealand,
                scoring a partnership of 70 before Latham was caught by Kohli
                off the bowling of Ashwin. Conway, who batted for a total of
                three hours during the afternoon, went on to score the game's
                first half century.<br> India's bowlers were unlucky at times,
                as New Zealand's batsmen edged several balls from Shami which
                missed the fielders. India eventually dismissed Conway shortly
                before the close of play, the batsman making an error in hitting
                a ball straight to the mid-on fielder off the bowling of fast
                bowler Ishant Sharma.<br> The umpires then halted play for bad
                light at around 6:27pm, leaving New Zealand with a score of 101
                for two. Williamson and Ross Taylor were the New Zealand batsmen
                at the close of play.<br>

                <h5> Day 4 </h5>
                The fourth day of the Test was rained out and no play was
                possible. New Zealand remained at 101 for the loss of two
                wickets.<br>

                <h5>Day 5 </h5>
                Ageas bowl before the start of the play on day 6

                The start of the fifth day was delayed due to rain with play
                resuming at around 11:30am BST.<br> Ishant Sharma opened the day's
                bowling with Williamson and Taylor the batsmen. New Zealand got
                off to a slow start, inching to 117 for two at the end of the
                first hour of play. Shami and Ishant Sharma then struck, taking
                the wickets of Taylor, BJ Watling, and Henry Nicholls in the
                morning session and leaving New Zealand with a score of 135 for
                five at lunch.<br>

                Williamson and new batsman Colin de Grandhomme worked to
                stabilise the New Zealand innings after lunch, advancing the
                score to 152 runs by the 80th over when India took the new ball.
                Shami got the first breakthrough of the afternoon session by
                dismissing De Grandhomme for 13 runs, lbw off a good length
                delivery. <br>The Indian fast bowlers attempted to keep the
                pressure on, but New Zealand's tailenders were able to add an
                additional 82 runs before the team were all out for 249. Captain
                Williamson fell just short of a fifty, scoring 49 runs before
                being caught at second slip by Kohli off the bowling of Sharma.<br>

                India started their second innings trailing New Zealand by 32
                runs with Rohit Sharma and Gill once again opening the innings.
                Gill was the first to fall, to Southee, being dismissed lbw for
                a score of 8 runs with the team at 24 for one, and Rohit Sharma
                also fell lbw to Southee. <br>India were 64 for two, leading by
                32 runs, when play was called off for the day. Pujara and Kohli
                were the two not out Indian batsmen at the close of play.

                <h5> Day 6 (Reserve Day)</h5>
                The sixth day of the Test was the official reserve day,
                allocated for weather related delays. India started the day on
                their overnight score of 64 for the loss of two wickets, with
                captain Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara at the crease.<br> The
                pair only managed to add seven runs before Kohli was out caught
                behind by the wicket-keeper Watling off the bowling of Jamieson.
                Jamieson followed it up with the wicket of Pujara in his next
                over, caught at first slip, leaving India at 72 for four.<br>
                Rahane was the next batsman out, caught behind by Watling off
                the bowling of Boult. Pant and Jadeja took the team to lunch at
                98 runs for five.<br>

                The post-lunch session saw Jadeja falling to medium-pacer Wagner
                with Watling securing a catch off a nick on the offside. Pant,
                the last recognised batsman, attempted to add runs quickly, but
                he then fell to Boult with Nicholls running in from point and
                catching the ball over his shoulders.<br> Pant had scored 41,
                the highest score amongst the Indian batsman, and the team was
                at 157 for seven at that stage. This left the Indian tailenders
                batting, and they advanced the score to 170 before the team were
                all out.<br>

                New Zealand started off with openers Latham and Conway, chasing
                a target of 139. The openers scored 33 runs but both were then
                dismissed by spinner Ashwin, leaving New Zealand at 44 for two.
                The Guardian's Adam Collins noted that New Zealand had appeared
                to be heading for an easy victory, but the second wicket
                prompted him to write "game very much on" in his commentary.<br>
                Williamson was joined by Taylor, and India then bowled four
                maiden overs in a row with the score on 46 for two, with New
                Zealand still needing 93 more runs to win from 31 overs.<br>
                They began to score more freely again from the 23rd over,
                however, and Williamson and Taylor remained at the crease for
                the remainder of the innings as New Zealand advanced to 140 for
                two in the 46th over, winning the match by eight wickets.
                Williamson scored a half-century of 52, and Taylor scored 47,
                ensuring that the New Zealand team comfortably achieved the
                target, and won the Test match.<br> It was Kohli's third defeat
                as the captain of India in knockouts and finals of ICC
                tournaments.</p>

            <h3>format</h3>
            <p>
                The tournament was played over two years. Each team were
                scheduled to play six other opponents, three at home and
                three away. Each series consisted of between two and
                five Test matches. <br>Therefore, all participants did
                not play the same number of Tests, but played the same
                number of series. At the end of the league stage the top
                two teams played in the final. Each match is scheduled
                for a duration of five days.
            </p>
            <h3>Point scoring</h3>
            <p>The ICC decided that the same number of points would be
                available from each series, regardless of series length,
                so that countries that played fewer Tests were not
                disadvantaged. It also decided that points would not be
                awarded for series results, but for match results only.
                <br>These would be split equally between all the matches
                in the series, regardless of whether or not a match was
                a dead rubber, so that every match counted. In a
                five-match series, therefore, 20% of the points would be
                available each match, while in a two-match series, 50%
                of the points would be available each match.<br><br><br><br>
                Therefore, depending on whether the series is 2, 3, 4 or
                5 matches long, the number of points awarded for a
                single match win would be a half, a third, a quarter, or
                a fifth of the maximum possible from the series. <br>The
                ICC also decided that a tie should be worth half of a
                win and that a draw should be worth a third of a win.
                <br>This all meant that after each match, a side could
                be awarded a half, a third, a quarter, a fifth, a sixth,
                an eighth, a ninth, a tenth, a twelfth or a fifteenth of
                the total points available from the series, depending on
                the result and how many matches the series happened to
                consist of. Ultimately, this meant a figure for the
                total points available from the series needs to be
                picked very carefully, as not many numbers give all
                integers when split into all these different fractions
                (360 does). <br>Being a highly composite number, when
                120 was split into all these fractions, an integer was
                obtained in all cases except one – the points awarded
                for a draw in a 3-match series should be 131⁄3 (a third
                of a third of 120), but the 1⁄3 had been dropped.</p>
            <p>
                Each series would therefore carry a maximum of 120
                points

                A team that was behind the required over rate at the end of a
                match would have two competition points deducted for each over
                it was behind.<br> In January 2020, South Africa became the
                first team to be docked World Test Championship points, after a
                slow over-rate in the fourth Test against England.

                England <br>
                India <br>

                South Africa <br>
                Sri Lanka <br>
                West Indies <br>
                >> Since each team played only six of the eight possible
                opponents, the ICC announced that India and Pakistan would not
                play against each other in the first and second editions of the
                tournament.<br>
                The schedule for the World Test Championship was announced by
                the ICC on 20 June 2018, as part of the 2018–2023 Future Tours
                Programme.

                Rather than being a full round-robin tournament in which
                everyone played everyone else equally, each team played only six
                of the other eight.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic impacted on international cricket fixtures,
                including matches in the Championship. In March 2020, the second
                Test match between Pakistan and Bangladesh was postponed due to
                the pandemic. Later the same month, the two-match series between
                Sri Lanka and England was also postponed. The following month
                saw Australia's tour to Bangladesh and the West Indies tour to
                England being postponed. In June 2020, the two-match
                series between Bangladesh and New Zealand and the three-match
                series between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh were both postponed.
                South Africa's tour of the West Indies was postponed, after the
                fixtures clashed with the West Indies rescheduled tour to
                England.<br><br>

                On 29 July 2020, the ICC confirmed that their attention had
                moved to the fixtures in the World Test Championship, with their
                priority on rescheduling the six Test series that had been
                postponed. The ICC ultimately accepted several series would not
                take place as part of the Championship and changed the points
                system to account for the variation in the number of series
                played per team.</p>
