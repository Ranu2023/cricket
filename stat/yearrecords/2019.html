                <p>The 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup was the 12th Cricket World
                    Cup, a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket
                    tournament contested by men's national teams and organised
                    by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The tournament
                    was hosted between 30 May and 14 July across 10 venues in
                    England and a single venue in Wales. It was the fifth time
                    that England had hosted the World Cup, while for Wales it
                    was their third.</p>
                <p>The tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14
                    teams in the previous edition, with the format of the
                    tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the
                    top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage.
                    After six weeks of round-robin matches, which saw four games
                    not have a result, India, Australia, England and New Zealand
                    finished as the top four, with Pakistan missing out on net
                    run rate..</p>
                <p>In the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their
                    respective semi-finals to qualify for the final, which was
                    played at Lord's in London. The final ended in a tie after
                    the match ended with both teams scoring 241 runs, followed
                    by the first Super Over in an ODI; England won the title,
                    their first, on the boundary countback rule after the Super
                    Over also finished level. The total attendance throughout
                    the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup was 752,000.[1] Overall,
                    videos of the group stages amassed over 2.6 billion views
                    from around the world, making it the most-watched cricket
                    competition as of 2019.</p>
                <!-- <h3>Controversies</h3> -->
                <!-- <p>The Pool A match between Australia and England ended when James
					Anderson was run out straight after James Taylor was given out lbw.
					Because Taylor's decision was reviewed and overturned, the ICC later
					admitted that the ball should have been declared dead (according to
					Article 3.6a of Appendix 6 of the Decision Review System Playing
					Conditions), and so Anderson was incorrectly given out.</p>
				<p>During the Pool B match between Ireland and Zimbabwe, Sean
					Williams was caught by Ireland's John Mooney in a close run chase.
					Mooney was extremely close to the boundary and eight different
					television replays were inconclusive as to whether his foot had touched
					the boundary rope. Meanwhile, Williams had walked and the umpires
					signalled him out.</p> -->
                <h3>format</h3>
                <p>The knockout stage started with semi-finals at Old Trafford
                    and Edgbaston, the winners of each progressing to the final
                    at Lord's. All three knockout games were allotted a reserve
                    day.[109] If a reserve day came into play, the match would
                    not be restarted but instead resumed from the previous day's
                    play, if there was any.<br> In the event of no play on the
                    scheduled day or the reserve day, in the semi-finals, the
                    team that finished higher in the group stage progressed to
                    the final, and if no play were possible in the final, the
                    trophy would be shared. If any match ended in a tie, a Super
                    Over would be used to determine the winner. If the scores in
                    the Super Over were also tied, the winner would be
                    determined by the two teams' overall boundary count,
                    including both the match itself and the Super Over.
                </p>
                <p>On 25 June 2019, Australia became the first team to qualify
                    for the semi-finals after beating England at Lord's. India
                    became the second team to qualify after they defeated
                    Bangladesh at Edgbaston on 2 July 2019. The following day
                    saw tournament hosts England become the third team to
                    qualify after they beat New Zealand at the Riverside Ground.
                    <br>After Pakistan were unable to increase their net run
                    rate sufficiently enough in their match against Bangladesh
                    at Lord's New Zealand were the fourth and final team to
                    qualify for the semi-finals.

                    The first semi-final was played between India and New
                    Zealand at Old Trafford, while the second semi-final was
                    played between Australia and England at Edgbaston.

                <h4 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 166);">final</h4>
                <p>After New Zealand won the toss and chose to bat first, Henry
                    Nicholls' first half-century of the tournament and a further
                    47 from wicket-keeper Tom Latham helped the Kiwis to a total
                    of 241/8 from their 50 overs, as Chris Woakes and Liam
                    Plunkett each secured three wickets for the hosts.
                    Defending a middling score, the New Zealand bowlers bowled
                    effectively, hampering England's top order, with only Jonny
                    Bairstow managing more than a start with 36. With the loss
                    of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over,
                    however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos
                    Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game
                    before Buttler was caught on 59. <br>However, with five
                    overs to play, England still required another 46 runs, and
                    the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively.
                    Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score
                    runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over,
                    two wickets still in hand.<br> After two dot balls, Stokes
                    first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on
                    the next ball, the fielder's throw deflected off Stokes' bat
                    as he was coming back for a second run and went to the
                    boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena
                    awarded six runs for that delivery, although one
                    interpretation of Laws of Cricket was that it should have
                    resulted in only five runs being awarded as one of the runs
                    should have not counted as the batsmen had not crossed
                    during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder
                    threw the ball in.<br> The final two deliveries of the over
                    saw England get a run each, but losing their last two
                    wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the scores
                    tied at 241 with Stokes left unbeaten with 84.<br>

                    With the scores tied, the match went to a Super Over.
                    England returned Stokes and Buttler to the crease, and they
                    handled Trent Boult's bowling to accumulate 15 runs without
                    loss. For New Zealand, Martin Guptill and James Neesham went
                    in to face Jofra Archer needing at least 16 runs to claim
                    the title. <br>After a steady accumulation of runs,
                    including a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two
                    from the final delivery, Guptill hit the ball out to deep
                    mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run,
                    but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill
                    being well short of his crease. <br>New Zealand finished
                    with 15 runs to tie the Super Over, but England's superior
                    boundary count in the match and Super Over combined (26 to
                    New Zealand's 17) meant they claimed the World Cup title for
                    the first time after three previous final defeats in 1979,
                    1987 and 1992. <br> This game has gone down in history as
                    one of the greatest ever finals, and games, in cricketing
                    history. Ben Stokes was named man of the match; referring to
                    the controversial overthrows that deflected off his bat, he
                    said he would be
                    "apologising to [New Zealand captain Kane Williamson] for the rest of [his] life",
                    and later said England's first World Cup victory was
                    "written in the stars"</p><br>
