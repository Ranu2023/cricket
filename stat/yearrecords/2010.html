                <p> 16 May 2010</p>
                <p>The 2010 ICC World Twenty20 was the third Men's T20 World Cup
                    competition, an international Twenty20 cricket tournament
                    that was held in the West Indies between 30 April and 16 May
                    2010. It was won by England, who defeated Australia in
                    the final. Kevin Pietersen was named as player of the
                    tournament.</p>
                <p>Although the tournament was held every two years beginning in
                    2007, the scheduled ICC Champions Trophy, One Day
                    International tournament to be held in the West Indies in
                    2010 was revised to a Twenty20 format because the 2008
                    Champions Trophy tournament in Pakistan was postponed due to
                    security concerns and there was a need to correct the
                    international cricketing tournament calendar.</p>
                <p>
                    This ICC World Twenty20 took place only 10 months after the
                    last one. As before, the tournament featured 12 teams – the
                    Test-playing nations and two qualifiers. Matches were played
                    at three grounds – Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados;
                    Providence Stadium in Providence, Guyana; and Beausejour
                    Stadium in Gros Islet, Saint Lucia. The tournament was
                    organised in parallel with the women's tournament, with the
                    men's semi-finals and final each being preceded by the
                    semi-finals and final from the women's event.<br><br>

                    This competition also saw Afghanistan make their first ever
                    appearance in a major ICC international cricket tournament,
                    and was made even more remarkable as at the time they only
                    held Affiliate Membership and subsequently became the only
                    Affiliate member ever to compete in a major ICC
                    international cricket tournament.
                </p>
                <h5>Super 8s</h5>
                <p>The Super 8s stage consists of the top two teams from each
                    group of the group stage. The teams are split into two
                    groups, Groups E and F. Group E will consist of the top seed
                    from Groups A and C, and the second seed of groups B and D.
                    Group F will consist of the top seed from Groups B and D,
                    and the second seed of groups A and C.
                    <br>The seedings used are those allocated at the start of
                    the tournament and are not affected by group stage results,
                    with the exception of if a non-seeded team knocks out a
                    seeded team, the non-seeded team inherits the seed of the
                    knocked-out team.</p>

                <h3>Final</h3>
                <p>The final, played in Barbados on 16 May 2010, featured the
                    game's oldest rivalry less than six months before the Ashes
                    in Australia.<br> England won by seven wickets with three
                    overs to spare to seal its first International Cricket
                    Council world championship after losses in three World Cup
                    finals – 1979 against the West Indies at Lord's, 1987
                    against Australia and 1992 against Pakistan – and a loss in
                    the 2004 Champions Trophy final to the West Indies on home
                    soil.<br> Australia batted first and scored 147 runs for the
                    loss of six wickets, with David Hussey's top score of 59
                    proving crucial after England had reduced the Aussies to 8/3
                    after 2.1 overs and then removed captain Michael Clarke.<br>
                    England bettered Australia's total with 18 balls to spare,
                    reaching 148 runs for the loss of three wickets, with Craig
                    Kieswetter (63 runs) and Kevin Pietersen (47 runs) combining
                    for a 111-run partnership for the second wicket before
                    captain Paul Collingwood hit the winning run.<br> Pietersen
                    was subsequently named Man of the Tournament having scored
                    248 runs, while Kieswetter was named Man of the Match having
                    scored his first T20 international half-century in the
                    final.</p>
                <p> 2010 ICC World Twenty20 Final<br />
                    In the final, the England beat Australia by 7 wickets, after
                    an
                    accomplished innings from batter and bowler .<br />
                    Ryan Sidebottom 2/26 (4 overs) <br>
                    Craig Kieswetter 63 (49)
                </p>

                <h3>format</h3>
                <p>The 12 participant teams were divided into four groups of
                    three teams
                    each. The groups were announced on 4 July 2009. The initial
                    four group format is the same as that used at the 2009
                    tournament.<br> The top two teams from each
                    group went
                    through to the second stage of the tournament.</p>
                <p>The eight teams were divided into two groups of four teams
                    each. The two
                    top teams from each Super Eight group qualified for the
                    semi-finals</p>
