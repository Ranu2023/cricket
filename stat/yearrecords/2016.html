                <h3>memories</h3>
                <p> 3 April 2016</p>
                <p>The 2016 ICC World Twenty20 was the sixth edition of the ICC
                    World Twenty20, the world championship of Twenty20
                    International cricket. It was held in India from 8 March to
                    3 April 2016, and was the first edition to be hosted by
                    India..</p>
                <p>Seven cities hosted matches in the tournament – Bangalore,
                    Dharamshala, Kolkata, Mohali, Mumbai, Nagpur, and New Delhi.
                    For the second time, there were 16 participating teams, 10
                    of which qualified automatically due to their status as full
                    members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and
                    another six qualifying through the 2015 World Twenty20
                    Qualifier. <br>The tournament was divided into three stages.
                    In the first stage, the eight lowest-ranked teams played
                    off, with the top two joining the eight highest-ranked teams
                    in the Super 10 stage. Finally, the top four teams overall
                    contested the knockout stage.<br> In the final, played at
                    Eden Gardens, Kolkata, the West Indies defeated England by
                    four wickets. Indian batsman Virat Kohli was named the
                    player of the tournament, while Bangladesh's Tamim Iqbal and
                    Afghanistan's Mohammad Nabi led the tournament in runs and
                    wickets, respectively.</p>
                <h5>Super 10s</h5>
                <p>For the second time, the tournament featured 16 teams. All
                    ten full members qualified automatically, joined by the six
                    associate members: Ireland, Scotland, Netherlands,
                    Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Oman who all qualified through
                    the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, played in Ireland and
                    Scotland between 6 and 26 July 2015. Oman made its debut in
                    the tournament.

                    <br> The top eight Full Member nations in the ICC T20I
                    Championship rankings as of 30 April 2014 automatically
                    progressed to the Super 10 stage, with the remaining eight
                    teams competing in the group stage. From the group stage,
                    Bangladesh and associate nation Afghanistan advanced to the
                    Super 10 stage. Test playing nation Zimbabwe and Ireland
                    failed to advance to the Super 10 stage for the second time.<br>

                    <br> In October 2015 Shahryar Khan, chairman of the Pakistan
                    Cricket Board (PCB), said that Pakistan would consider
                    pulling out of the tournament if the series against India
                    did not go ahead.[5] Although the series was ultimately
                    cancelled, Pakistan received government clearance in
                    February 2016 to visit India to compete in the tournament.
                    In early March, Pakistan sent a delegation to assess the
                    security arrangements ahead of the tournament. Following the
                    visit, the match between India and Pakistan was moved from
                    Dharamsala to Eden Gardens in Kolkata, at the request of the
                    PCB, and on 11 March, Pakistan confirmed their participation
                    at the tournament.</p>

                <h3>Final</h3>
                <p>England and the West Indies were both contesting the
                    tournament final for a second time, having won one previous
                    tournament each (in 2010 and 2012, respectively). West
                    Indian captain Darren Sammy won the toss and elected to
                    bowl, as he had done throughout the tournament. England
                    posted a total of 155/9 from their 20 overs, with Joe Root
                    top-scoring with 54 runs from 36 balls.<br> For the West
                    Indies, Carlos Brathwaite took 3/23 and Samuel Badree took
                    2/16, including a maiden. The West Indies subsequently
                    reached their target with just two balls to spare. <br>They
                    required 19 runs from the final over, bowled by Ben Stokes,
                    which Brathwaite reached by hitting four consecutive sixes.
                    Marlon Samuels scored 85 not out from 66 balls – the highest
                    score in World T20 final history – and was named the final's
                    Man of the Match for the second time. The match was played
                    to a near-capacity crowd, with 66,000 people in attendance</p>

                    next round. Second round was the Super 10 stage which
                    consisted of 2 groups of 5 teams each. <br>The top eight
                    Full
                    Member nations in the ICC T20I Championship rankings as of 8

                    of 2014 ICC World Twenty20.</p>
                <p>The ten teams were divided into two groups of five teams
                    each. The two
                    top teams from each Super ten group qualified for the
