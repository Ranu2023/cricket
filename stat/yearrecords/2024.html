                <!-- <h3>memories</h3>
                 <p> 13 November 2022</p> 
                <p>The 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was the eighth ICC Men's T20
                    World Cup tournament. It was played in Australia from 16
                    October to 13 November 2022. In the final, England beat
                    Pakistan by five wickets to win their second ICC Men's T20
                    World Cup title. Sam Curran was named the Player of the
                    match and also the Player of the tournament.</p>
                <p>Although originally scheduled to be held in 2020, the
                    International Cricket Council (ICC) postponed the tournament
                    because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the re-arranged
                    tournament held in Australia in 2022. The host nation were
                    also the defending champions.</p>
                <p>
                    The host cities for matches were Adelaide, Brisbane,
                    Geelong, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The
                    semi-finals took place at the Sydney Cricket Ground where
                    Pakistan beat New Zealand by seven wickets, and at the
                    Adelaide Oval where England beat India by ten wickets.
                </p>
                <p>A series of global qualifying matches took place for the
                    right to play in the group stages of the tournament, with
                    the two best placed teams from the groups entering the Super
                    12 stage, to compete alongside eight pre-qualified nations.
                    <p>
                        <p>In April 2018, the ICC announced that the tournament
                            would replace the scheduled 2021 ICC Champions
                            Trophy. This was after the ICC granted full
                            international status to Twenty20 matches played
                            between member sides from 1 January 2019 onwards.
                        </p>

                        <h4>qualification</h4>
                        <p>In October 2019, it was reported that the ICC could
                            scrap the T20 World Cup Qualifier, which would have
                            been used as a pathway for qualification to the T20
                            World Cup. Therefore, twelve teams from the 2020 ICC
                            T20 World Cup and four teams from qualification
                            events would advance to the T20 World Cup.<br> On 23
                            January 2020, the ICC confirmed the full details of
                            qualification for the tournament. In May 2020, the
                            ICC told the Board of Control for Cricket in India
                            (BCCI) that they reserve the rights to take away
                            hosting rights from India, after the BCCI did not
                            secure a tax exemption from the Indian government
                            for the tournament</p>
                        <p>In July 2020, when the previous edition of the
                            tournament was being reviewed due to the COVID-19
                            pandemic, Earl Eddings, the chairman of Cricket
                            Australia suggested that Australia could host that
                            tournament in October 2021, and India stage this
                            tournament a year later in 2022.<br> The ICC also
                            confirmed that either Australia or India, the hosts
                            for the tournaments originally scheduled to take
                            place in 2020 and 2021 respectively, would host this
                            tournament.

                        </p>
                        <h3> venues </h3>
                        <p>On 15 November 2021, the ICC confirmed the venues
                            that would host matches across the tournament. The
                            host cities were Adelaide, Brisbane, Geelong,
                            Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The semi-finals
                            took place at the Sydney Cricket Ground and the
                            Adelaide Oval, with the final taking place at the
                            Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>

                            the
                            tournament based on the ICC T20I team rankings as of
                            March

                            <h3>Final</h3>

                                >England won their second T20 World Cup title.<br>
                                >England became the first men's team to hold
                                both the ODI (50-over) and T20 World Cups
                                simultaneously.<br>
                                Pakistan were asked to bat first who then scored
                                a total of 137 runs for the fall of 8 wickets.
                                Shan Masood was Pakistan's top scorer with 38
                                runs. England's Sam Curran finished with the
                                figures of 3 wickets for 12 runs.<br>

                                In the second innings, England finished the
                                six-over powerplay with 49 runs for 3 wickets.
                                In the 13th over, the game changed when Shaheen
                                Shah Afridi slid forwards to take a catch off
                                Shadab Khan, dismissing Harry Brook. Shaheen
                                jarred his right knee in the process.<br> With
                                England needing 41 runs off five overs, Shaheen
                                attempted to return for his third over after
                                receiving some treatment. But he pulled out of
                                his run-up once, then sent one down to Moeen Ali
                                at 114 kph. Iftikhar Ahmed then completed
                                Shaheen's remaining over after he took off the
                                field.<br> With scores level after Ben Stokes
                                had brought up his maiden T20I fifty, he scored
                                the winning run with six balls to spare.<br />
                                Sam Curran 3/12 (4 overs) <br>
                                Ben Stokes 52* (49)
