				<h3>memories</h3>
				<p> 24 September 2007</p>
				<p>The 2007 ICC World Twenty20 was the inaugural Twenty20 International
					cricket world championship, contested in South Africa from 11 to 24
					September 2007. Twelve teams took part in the thirteen-day tournamentâ€”the
					ten Test-playing nations and the finalists of the 2007 WCL Division One
					tournament: Kenya and Scotland. India won the tournament, beating Pakistan
					in the final.</p>
				<p>India won the toss and chose to bat on what was considered to be a
					traditionally batsman-friendly pitch at the Bullring. Umar Gul took the
					wickets of both Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, leaving India with
					157/5 in 20 overs; only Gautam Gambhir (75 from 54 balls) produced a
					notable innings.<br> A 21-run over from Sreesanth swung the game towards
					Pakistan. However, Irfan Pathan (3/16), RP Singh (3/26) and Joginder Sharma
					(2/20) slowed the scoring dramatically. With Pakistan needing 54 from 24
					balls, Misbah-ul-Haq hit 3 sixes off Harbhajan Singh in one over. Sreesanth
					was also dispatched for 2 sixes but took the wicket of Sohail Tanvir, as
					Pakistan went into the last over needing 13 runs to win, with only 1 wicket
					remaining. <br>Joginder Sharma bowled a wide first ball, followed by a dot
					ball. Misbah followed by taking six off a full-toss; Pakistan needed just 6
					runs to win from the last four balls. Misbah attempted to hit the next ball
					with a paddle-scoop over fine leg, but he only managed to sky the ball, and
					it was caught at short fine-leg by Sreesanth, leaving Pakistan all out for
					152 runs. <br>Irfan Pathan was awarded the Man of the Match for his spell,
					which included 3 wickets for 16 runs, including that of Man of the Series,
					Shahid Afridi</p>
				<h5>Super 8s</h5>
				<p>
					This tournament's Super Eight format was designed such that the top 2 seeds
					from each group was pre-decided at the start of the tournament. The actual
					performance of the team in the Group Stage played no role in determining if
					the team qualified into Super Eight Group E or F. For example, in Group C,
					though Sri Lanka finished with more points than New Zealand, for the
					purpose of the Super Eight groupings, New Zealand retained the group's top
					seed position (C1) while Sri Lanka retained the group's second seed
					position (C2).<br>

					In case a third-seeded team qualified ahead of the two top-seeded teams, it
					took on the seed of the eliminated team. This only happened in Group A,
					where Bangladesh (original seed A3) qualified ahead of West Indies
					(original seed A2) and therefore took on the A2 spot in Group F. The other
					seven top seeds qualified.<br>

					The eight teams were divided into two groups of four teams each. The two
					top teams from each Super Eight group qualified for the semi-finals.</p>
				<h3>Final</h3><p> 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Final<br />
					In the final, the India beat Pakistan by 5 runs, after an
					accomplished innings from batter and bowler <br />
					Gautam Gambhir 75 (54)<br>
					Irfan Pathan 3/16 (4)
				</p>

				<h3>format</h3>
				<p>The 12 participant teams were divided into four groups of three teams
					each. The groups were determined based on the rankings of the teams in
					Twenty20 as of 1 March 2007.<br> The top two teams from each group went
					through to the second stage of the tournament.</p>
				<p>The eight teams were divided into two groups of four teams each. The two
					top teams from each Super Eight group qualified for the semi-finals</p>
