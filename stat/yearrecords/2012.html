                    first World Twenty20 tournament held in an Asian country,
                    the last three having been held in South Africa, England and
                    the West Indies. Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga had been
                    chosen as the event ambassador of the tournament by ICC. The
                    format had four groups of three teams in a preliminary round</p>
                <p>The 2012 World Twenty20 is the fourth edition of the Twenty20

                    where India beat Pakistan in a thriller to become Twenty20
                    champions.<br> Pakistan, the losing finalists in 2007,
                    defeated Sri Lanka in 2009 tournament to become World T20

                <h5>Super 8s</h5>
                <p>The Super 8s stage consists of the top two teams from each
                    group of the group stage. The teams are split into two
                    groups, Groups E and F. Group E will consist of the top seed
                    from Groups A and C, and the second seed of groups B and D.

                    and the second seed of groups A and C.

                    the tournament and are not affected by group stage results,
                    with the exception of if a non-seeded team knocks out a
                    seeded team, the non-seeded team inherits the seed of the
                    knocked-out team.</p>
