                <p> 24 September 2007</p>
                <p>The 2009 ICC World Twenty20 was an international Twenty20
                    cricket tournament organised by the International Cricket
                    Council (ICC) that took place in England in June 2009. It
                    was the second ICC World Twenty20 tournament, following the
                    inaugural event in South Africa in September 2007.<br>
                    As before, the tournament featured 12 male teams – nine of
                    the ten Test-playing nations and three associate nations,
                    which earned their places through a qualification
                    tournament. Matches were played at three English grounds –
                    Lord's and The Oval in London, and Trent Bridge in
                    Nottingham. The tournament was organised in parallel with
                    the women's tournament, with the men's semi-finals and final
                    being preceded by the semi-finals and final from the women's
                    event. <br>The final took place at Lord's on Sunday 21 June
                    with Pakistan beating Sri Lanka by eight wickets and England
                    beating New Zealand by six wickets in the women's final.</p>
                <p>
                    In December 2007, the ICC provisionally approved a Women's
                    World Twenty20 to run alongside the men's event which,
                    subject to the approval of the ICC's finance and commercial
                    affairs committee, would come into effect for the 2009
                    tournament in England.<br>

                    In early January 2008, speculation arose that the tournament
                    could be held elsewhere as the British government have
                    banned Zimbabwe from touring England in 2009. However, it
                    was later confirmed that the tournament would definitely
                    take place in the country.<br>

                    In April 2008, the third venue was confirmed as Nottingham's
                    Trent Bridge; the 17,500 seater stadium was chosen to hold
                    one of the semi-finals, among other earlier matches. Lord's
                    and The Oval are the two other confirmed venues, with the
                    opening match and final being played at Lord's. Old Trafford
                    Cricket Ground had bid for the third venue, but Trent Bridge
                    was chosen for its closer proximity to the two London
                    grounds.</p>
                <h5>Super 8s</h5>
                <p>The Super 8s consisted of two groups: Group E and Group F.
                    Group E consisted of A1, B2, C1, D2 and Group F consisted of
                    A2, B1, C2, D1, where X1 is the first seed from Group X and
                    X2 is the second seed from Group X. The seedings were based
                    on performance in the last ICC T20 (2007). If a non-seeded
                    team knocks out a seeded team, the non-seeded team inherits
                    the seed of the team it knocked out.

                <h3>Final</h3><p> 2009 ICC World Twenty20 Final<br />
                    In the final, the Pakistan beat sri Lanka by 8 wicket, after
                    an
                    accomplished innings from batter and bowler <br />
                    Abdul Razzaq 3/20 (3 overs)
                    Shahid Afridi 54* (40)
                </p>

                <h3>format</h3>
                <p>The 12 participant teams were divided into four groups of
                    three teams
                    each.The groups were announced on 31 October 2007, based on
                    finishing positions at the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and the
                    successful qualifying associate nations.<br> The initial
                    four group format is the same as that used at the 2007
                    tournament.<br> The top two teams from each
                    group went
                    through to the second stage of the tournament.</p>
                <p>The eight teams were divided into two groups of four teams
                    each. The two
                    top teams from each Super Eight group qualified for the
                    semi-finals</p>
